    "unique elements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is nascent, and many technologies \\\n",

    "foundations of machine learning and \\\n",
    "deep learning are maturing — and \\\n",

    "important in AI than fields that \\\n",

    "Project work often means working \\\n",

    "challenging to find a suitable \\\n",
    "project, estimate the project’s \\\n",

    "While searching for a job in AI can \\\n",

    "In this letter, I’d like to \\\n",
    "dive more deeply into the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "More papers have been published on AI \\\n",
    "than any person can read in \\\n",
    "a lifetime. So, in your efforts to learn, \\\n",
    "it’s critical to \\\n",
    "prioritize topic selection. I believe the \\\n",
    "most important topics \\\n",
    "for a technical career in machine learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundational machine learning skills. For \\\n",
    "example, it’s important \\\n",
    "to understand models such as linear \\\n",
    "regression, logistic regression, \\\n",
    "neural networks, decision trees, clustering, \\\n",
    "and anomaly detection. \\\n",
    "Beyond specific models, it’s even more \\\n",
    "important to understand the \\\n",
    "core concepts behind how and why machine \\\n",
    "learning works, such as \\\n",
    "bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \\\n",
    "optimization algorithms, \\\n",
    "and error analysis.\n",
    "Deep learning. This has become such a large \\\n",
    "fraction of machine \\\n",
    "learning that it’s hard to excel in the \\\n",
    "field without some understanding \\\n",
    "of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of \\\n",
    "neural networks, practical \\\n",
    "skills for making them work (such as \\\n",
    "hyperparameter tuning), \\\n",
    "convolutional networks, sequence models, \\\n",
    "and transformers.\n",
    "Math relevant to machine learning. Key \\\n",
    "areas include linear \\\n",
    "algebra (vectors, matrices, and various \\\n",
    "manipulations of them) \\\n",
    "as well as probability and statistics \\\n",
    "(including discrete and \\\n",
    "continuous probability, standard probability \\\n",
    "distributions, \\\n",
    "basic rules such as independence and Bayes \\\n",
    "rule, and hypothesis \\\n",
    "testing). In addition, exploratory data \\\n",
    "analysis (EDA) — using \\\n",
    "visualizations and other methods to \\\n",
    "systematically explore a \\\n",
    "dataset — is an underrated skill. I’ve \\\n",
    "found EDA particularly \\\n",
    "useful in data-centric AI development, \\\n",
    "where analyzing errors \\\n",
    "and gaining insights can really help \\\n",
    "drive progress! Finally, \\\n",
    "a basic intuitive understanding of \\\n",
    "calculus will also help. \\\n",
    "In a previous letter, I described how \\\n",
    "the math \\\n",
    "needed to do machine learning well has \\\n",
    "been changing. For \\\n",
    "instance, although some tasks require \\\n",
    "calculus, improved automatic \\\n",
    "differentiation software makes it \\\n",
    "possible to invent and implement \\\n",
    "new neural network architectures \\\n",
    "without doing any calculus. This \\\n",
    "was almost impossible a decade ago.\\\n",
    "Software development. While you can \\\n",
    "get a job and \\\n",
    "make huge contributions with only machine \\\n",
    "learning modeling skills, \\\n",
    "your job opportunities will increase if \\\n",
    "you can also write \\\n",
    "good software to implement complex AI \\\n",
    "systems. These skills \\\n",
    "include programming fundamentals, data \\\n",
    "structures (especially those that \\\n",
    "relate to machine learning, such as \\\n",
    "data frames), \\\n",
    "algorithms (including those related to \\\n",
    "databases and data manipulation\\\n",
    "), software design, familiarity with Python, \\\n",
    "and familiarity \\\n",
    "with key libraries such as TensorFlow \\\n",
    "or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.\\\n",
    "This is a lot to learn! Even after you \\\n",
    "master everything in this list, I hope you’ll \\\n",
    "keep learning and continue to deepen \\\n",
    "your technical knowledge. \\\n",
    "I’ve known many machine learning engineers \\\n",
    "who benefitted \\\n",
    "from deeper skills in an application area \\\n",
    "such as natural \\\n",

    "How do you gain these skills? There’s \n",

    "in theory reading dozens of web pages could work. \n",
    "But when the goal is deep understanding, \\\n",
    "reading disjointed \n",
    "web pages is inefficient because they \\\n",
    "tend to repeat each \n",
    "other, use inconsistent terminology \\\n",
    "(which slows you down\n",
    "), vary in quality, and leave gaps. That\n",
    "’s why a good course — in which a \n",
    "body of material has been organized into \\\n",
    "a coherent and \n",

    "Keep reading and talking to people. I come \\\n",
    "up with \n",

    "taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’\n",
